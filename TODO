TODO

- install varnish, nginx is at 81
- install redis
- modifying settings.py in django to connect to db and dbsync/migrate as needed, see django formula for ideas

- move postgres-related lines from zinibu.python.init to postgres specific states, add include to zinibu.python.init.
- I may need to change /srv/salt/top.sls to point a minion, like 'db' to zinibu.postgresql, and the rest to zinibu (which, as mentioned above, is zinibu.init.sls) to work as webheads. As an example from http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/best_practices.html:

base:
  'web*':
    - mysql.client
    - mysql.python
  'db*':
    - mysql.server


- I want to run the whole thing with:
sudo salt '*' state.highstate

- get things working up to here with salt and then move to Varnish

- zinibu.python is doing django stuff and that should probably go to zinibu.django

- Check how to run pip upgrades like:
pip install Django --upgrade

- States for deployment, probably named zinibu.deploy, and find best way to indicate if it's development, staging, production (pass via pillar in command line, see README and python states). I think I just need to consider one box as one environment so minions' ids are enough to target the states. This means no more having dev, staging and production all on the same box.
