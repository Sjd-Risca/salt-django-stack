TODO

- States for deployment, probably named zinibu.deploy, and find best way to indicate if it's development, staging, production (pass via pillar in command line, see README and python states)

- Keep an example of copying a configuration file like the one in zinibu/gunicorn/init.sls.

- Keep an example of copying a file that includes some jinja changes. See if I can get some examples from old code.
