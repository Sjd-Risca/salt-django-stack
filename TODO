TODO

- I want to run the whole thing with:
sudo salt '*' state.highstate

and to do that I need to check that /srv/salt/top.sls is calling zinibu, which is actually zinibu/init.sls, and this is calling the rest of states so I have to go and check each of those states. I'm already done with a good part of zinibu.python.

- zinibu.python is doing django stuff and that should probably go to zinibu.django

- Check how to run pip upgrades like:
pip install Django --upgrade

- States for deployment, probably named zinibu.deploy, and find best way to indicate if it's development, staging, production (pass via pillar in command line, see README and python states). I think I just need to consider one box as one environment so minions' ids are enough to target the states. This means no more having dev, staging and production all on the same box.

- Keep an example of copying a file that includes some jinja changes and variables from grains and pillars. See zinibu/edit/vim.sls.

- Include multiple SLS files as needed, see zinibu/python/python_test.sls
