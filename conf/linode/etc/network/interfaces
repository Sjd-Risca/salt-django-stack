# We no longer need to use aliases (eg. eth0:0 eth0:1 eth0:2)
# This line ensures that the interface will be brought up during boot
auto eth0

# The address and gateway are necessary.
# The netmask is taken automatically from the block.
# Example: /24 is considered to be a public IP address: netmask 255.255.255.0
iface eth0 inet static
    address 198.51.100.5/24
    gateway 198.51.100.1

# This is a second public IP address
iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.0.2.6/24

# This is a private IP address. Private IPs do not have a gateway (they are not publicly routable).
# All you need to specify is the address and the block. The netmask is taken from the block.
# Example: /17 is considered to be a private IP address: netmask 255.255.128.0
iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.133.234/17
