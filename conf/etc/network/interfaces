# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
#auto eth0
#iface eth0 inet dhcp

# Configuration for eth0
# We no longer need to use aliases (eg. eth0:0 eth0:1 eth0:2)
# This line ensures that the interface will be brought up during boot
auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0

# The address and gateway are necessary.
# The netmask is taken automatically from the block.
# Example: /24 is considered to be a public IP address: netmask 255.255.255.0
iface eth0 inet static
    address 45.79.161.112/24
    gateway 45.79.161.1

# This is a private IP address. Private IPs do not have a gateway (they are not publicly routable).
# All you need to specify is the address and the block. The netmask is taken from the block.
# Example: /17 is considered to be a private IP address: netmask 255.255.128.0
iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.205.149/17
